# Catholic Sacramentals â€” English Edition (Parchment)

This Streamlit app ships with valid JPEG assets and safe image handling to avoid
`PIL.UnidentifiedImageError` and missing-file crashes.

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes
- Images in `assets/` are lightweight placeholders you can replace with real photos (keep filenames).
- If you swap images, ensure they are real JPEG/PNG files and committed to the repo.
